**Please read the below carefully**

Do not be an e-beggar and whine about low allocations

2,500 addresses (that's right, addresses. we don't count wallets as users cuz we're not retarded) were submitted to Berachain Foundation<p></p>
We weren't allowed to submit any more than that.
Go cry in Berachain Discord, not ours.

**Criteria:**

a) delegators : atleast 10 bgt delegated, share is calculated based on share of total delegations (minus excluded wallets)<p></p>
b) dapp users : staked/swapped/voted etc, with atleast 3 txs <p></p>
c) dapp farmers : all deposit/withdrawals/claiming txs, need atleast 3 txs (deposit, claim, withdraw or second claim/deposit whatever)<p></p>
d) trifecta users : took all deposit/withdrawals/claiming txs, need atleast 2 txs (deposit + claim)<p></p>

weighting based on how many of the above 4 actions were completed & how much BGT delegated
